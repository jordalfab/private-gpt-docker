BSS and OSS introduction

What are Support Systems and their Classification?
Computer systems and software applications used in these activities are referred to as support systems. These support systems can be further subdivided into two main categories:
1. Operational Support Systems (OSS). These systems are used to directly support network operations. Examples include:
- Keeping a record of the inventory available in the network.
- Providing telecom services using the network.
- Configuring network components to enable telecom services.
- Managing faults in the telecom network.
2. Business Support Systems (BSS). These systems are used to directly support business-related activities. Examples include:
- Taking orders from customers.
- Processing customer bills.
- Collecting payments from customers.
- Sales and marketing of telecom services.
- Customer care.

The Bigger Picture: Business Support System (BSS)
To understand the bigger picture of how the Business Support System (BSS) and the Operational Support System (OSS) interact with each other and with the network, let’s consider this diagram.
The diagram consists of four layers, with devices at the bottom-most layer. Depending on the network type, the required device varies:
- For a mobile wireless network (e.g., 5G, 4G, 3G), a mobile station is used.
- For a DSL network, a DSL modem is needed.
- For a fixed telephony network or a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a fixed telephone is required.
Since our focus is on mobile wireless networks, we’ll assume the device in use is a mobile station.
Before this mobile station can use the services of the mobile wireless network, these services need to be activated. This is where the Business Support System (BSS) comes into play. The first component of the BSS is the product catalog, which includes various plans such as prepaid, postpaid, and international roaming plans.
The user of the mobile station selects one or more plans from the product catalog. For example, if the user chooses a postpaid plan, the next step involves the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The CRM system registers the user and stores data that can be used for future lead generation, allowing the communication service provider to offer additional services based on this data.
Assuming the user has selected and placed an order for a postpaid plan, the next step is order management. During this step, the order is checked and verified, and the postpaid service is activated. The BSS sends the order to the OSS, which then activates the service in the network.
Once the service is activated, the user is charged for its usage. At the end of the month, a bill is generated for the service usage. This billing process is part of the revenue management system within the BSS.
Here, we see that the user directly interacts with the BSS to activate services, which is why these activities are referred to as customer-facing activities and are part of the BSS.

The Bigger Picture: Operational Support System (OSS)
In the previous step, we saw that the Business Support System (BSS) sends the order to the Operational Support System (OSS), which is responsible for service provisioning related to this order.
To deliver this service, the OSS first checks the network inventory to ensure sufficient resources are available. This includes verifying if the necessary capacity exists in the network to activate the service. If the network inventory confirms that the service can be provided, the service is then activated in the network.
To activate the service, the OSS sends a message to the network containing the required parameters for activation. Once the service is activated, it is crucial that it operates flawlessly. Service assurance, including customer care related to any faults, is also the responsibility of the OSS.
Another important aspect of the OSS is network management, which is handled by the Network Management System (NMS). The NMS monitors the network to ensure it is functioning properly, maintaining good performance, and that the services provided are working correctly. Any faults in the network or services are rectified and managed using the NMS.
Here, we see that the OSS directly interacts with the network, which is why these activities are referred to as network-facing activities.

Summarizing importance of OSS & BSS
In summary, we have a network infrastructure that is used to deliver services to customers. Managing and monitoring this network infrastructure is done using the Operational Support System (OSS) and the Business Support System (BSS).
While delivering services to customers, we need to manage these services and the associated business aspects. This is also handled by the OSS and BSS.
Additionally, we need to manage customer interactions, including marketing network services, delivering these services, and providing customer care in case of service faults. All these tasks are performed using the OSS and BSS, along with the software applications that implement these systems.
Therefore, the OSS and BSS are critical components of a communication service provider’s business.

Advantages of Automating OSS/BSS
Automating the Operational Support System (OSS) and Business Support System (BSS) using computer systems and software applications offers numerous advantages:
1. Reduced Time for Service Creation and Delivery. Automation significantly cuts down the time required to create and deliver new services to customers.
2. Efficient Network Monitoring and Operation. The network can be monitored more efficiently, leading to smoother operations and quicker fault resolution.
3. Lower Operational Costs. Automation reduces the operational costs of the network, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
4. Increased Customer Satisfaction. Faster fault resolution leads to higher customer satisfaction, which in turn boosts subscriber retention for the communication service provider.
5. Improved Return on Investment (ROI). Enhanced operational efficiency and customer satisfaction translate into better ROI for the communication service provider. This includes the overall investment in network deployment, personnel hiring, and network and service operations.
