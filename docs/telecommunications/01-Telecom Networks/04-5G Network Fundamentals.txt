
Key components of 5G wireless networks

5G is designed to offer much faster speeds and handle a lot more data than current networks. This helps reduce the time it takes for data to travel between the network and cloud computing systems, which are positioned at the "edge" or "core" of the network.

Some important technologies that make 5G possible are:

1. Millimeter Waves:
These are high-frequency radio waves (between 20 GHz and 300 GHz) that can carry a lot of data very quickly. They work much faster than the radio waves currently used by phones, which operate at lower frequencies. However, millimeter waves don’t travel very far, so they need more energy and coverage solutions.
- Analogy: Think of it like when you’re jumping rope. You can make big, slow waves that travel the whole length of the rope, or small, fast waves that don’t go as far. Millimeter waves are like those small, fast waves—lots of data, but they need more help to cover long distances.

2. More Cell Sites and Base Stations:
Since millimeter waves don’t travel far, 5G will need many more cell sites, especially small ones. This means there will be more antennas on rooftops, poles, and even inside buildings to make sure signals reach everywhere. For high-frequency 5G, antennas might need to be placed on every street corner in busy areas. Some estimates suggest there could be 100 to 350 cell sites per square kilometer in certain regions (about 260 to 900 per square mile).

3. Massive MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output):
This technology uses many antennas (up to 128 on both sides of a communication link) to send and receive data. The more antennas, the better the connection and capacity. Traditional MIMO uses only two to four antennas, but 5G's "massive MIMO" increases this significantly, improving the amount of data that can be handled.

4. Full-Duplex Communication:
Normally, radios send and receive data on different frequencies. With 5G, thanks to advances in switching technology, it’s possible to send and receive data on the same frequency at the same time. This increases the overall network capacity.

5. Beamforming:
Beamforming directs radio waves more precisely, like a laser compared to a light bulb. A light bulb spreads light in all directions, while a laser focuses it on one spot. In 5G, beamforming makes it easier to target specific devices with a stronger signal, even if they’re not directly in sight. Signals can "bounce" off buildings or objects to reach their destination.

In Summary:
- 5G uses millimeter waves that carry more data but don’t travel as far, so it needs more cell sites.
- It uses massive MIMO with many antennas to improve network capacity.
- Full-duplex communication allows sending and receiving data on the same frequency, increasing efficiency.
- Beamforming focuses signals like a laser, making connections stronger and more precise.


5G Non-Standalone (NSA) Networks
5G networks can be set up in two main ways:
1. Non-Standalone (NSA)
2. Standalone (SA)
In this explanation, we'll focus on 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) networks. This type of network uses both 4G LTE (the current system most phones use) and 5G together, instead of completely replacing the 4G system with 5G.

What is 5G Non-Standalone (NSA)?
In 5G NSA, the new 5G technology works alongside the existing 4G LTE infrastructure. This means:
- The 4G LTE parts of the network remain in place, and 5G is added on top.
- The only new parts are the 5G components (like 5G base stations called "G Node B"), while the rest of the network is still the same as 4G.

Why Use 5G NSA?
The main reason to use 5G NSA is speed and cost-efficiency:
- Faster deployment: Mobile network providers can roll out 5G more quickly because they don’t have to build an entirely new system.
- Lower costs: By reusing the existing 4G infrastructure, providers save money compared to creating a completely new network from scratch.

How Does 5G NSA Work?
Let’s break down how a 5G NSA network operates:
1. User Device (UE):
The UE refers to the user’s equipment, like a smartphone that supports both 4G LTE and 5G. This phone connects to both the 4G and 5G networks at the same time—this is called dual connectivity.
2. Connecting to the Network:
- First, your device connects to the 4G LTE network.
- The phone signals to the network that it can also connect to 5G.
- The 4G system checks if your device is allowed to use 5G.
- If approved, the network sets up a 5G connection for your phone, using a nearby 5G base station.
3. Dual Connectivity in Action:
Once connected:
- 4G LTE manages the control plane (the part of the network responsible for managing and controlling the connections).
- 5G handles the user data traffic (sending and receiving your data, like videos, messages, etc.).

Key Components in 5G NSA:
- User Equipment (UE): The phone or device that connects to both 4G and 5G networks.
- 4G LTE EnodeB: This is the 4G base station. It still manages most of the network control and communicates with 5G systems.
- 5G G Node B: This is the 5G base station. It handles the data your device sends and receives.
- Core Network (Evolved Packet Core - EPC): The EPC is the core part of the network that manages connections and data flow. In 5G NSA, it checks if devices can use both 4G and 5G and ensures smooth data transmission between them.

The Bottom Line:
- 5G NSA lets carriers and mobile operators get 5G to users faster, using existing 4G infrastructure.
- Only two key things change:
  1. The device (which needs to support both 4G and 5G).
  2. The radio access network (RAN), which adds 5G capability.

The core network (EPC) and much of the 4G infrastructure still play a major role in 5G NSA. This approach allows 5G to be deployed faster and at a lower cost while providing better speeds and performance for users.


5G Standalone (SA) Networks
What is 5G Standalone (SA)?
5G Standalone (SA) is the true, independent version of 5G. Unlike 5G Non-Standalone (NSA), which relies on existing 4G networks, 5G SA operates entirely on its own, without any need for 4G LTE infrastructure. This means that devices connect directly to the 5G base stations.

How Does 5G SA Work?
- Direct Connection to 5G: Devices, such as 5G-enabled phones, connect directly to G Node B, the 5G base station.
- Frequency Bands: 5G SA works on two frequency ranges:
1. FR1 (Sub-6 GHz): Lower frequencies that travel farther but carry less data.
2. FR2 (24 to 52 GHz, millimeter waves): Higher frequencies that can carry a lot more data, but don’t travel very far.

What Happens When a Device Connects to 5G SA?
1. Establishing Connection: The device (called UE, or User Equipment) connects to the G Node B (5G base station). The base station sets up a secure connection by initiating encryption and establishes communication with the 5G core network.
2. Network Functions:
The 5G core network handles tasks like:
- Checking if the device is allowed to connect.
- Setting up data channels for sending and receiving information.

Key Components of the 5G Standalone Architecture:
- Centralized Unit (CU) and Distributed Unit (DU):
The 5G base station (G Node B) is made up of two parts:
- The Centralized Unit (CU) handles things like mobility, session management, and user data transfers.
- The Distributed Unit (DU) takes care of lower-level tasks, like managing the physical radio signals and data transmission.
A single CU can control many DUs, allowing one base station to manage multiple cell sites.

The 5G Core Network:
The 5G Core is the brain of the network. It’s built on a Service-Based Architecture (SBA), where different parts of the network work together through interconnected functions. Here are some of the main functions:
1. AMF (Access and Mobility Function): Manages device registration and mobility (when a device moves between different cell towers).
2. AUSF (Authentication Server Function): Ensures that devices are properly authenticated and secure.
3. UDM (Unified Data Management): Handles user information, like subscriptions and authentication details.
4. PCF (Policy Control Function): Manages rules for how the network handles things like data usage, quality of service, and security.
5. SMF (Session Management Function): Controls data sessions, ensuring the device connects smoothly to the internet and other services.
6. UPF (User Plane Function): Handles actual user data transmission, such as streaming videos or browsing the web.
7. NRF (Network Repository Function): Keeps track of all the network’s functions, making sure they can communicate with each other efficiently.
8. NSSF (Network Slice Selection Function): Selects the appropriate "network slice" (a tailored network section) to meet the specific needs of an application, such as high-speed internet or low-latency connections for things like self-driving cars.

Additional Key Component: MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing)
MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing):
MEC brings computing and network functions closer to the edge of the network (near the users). This ensures ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth services, which are crucial for applications like self-driving cars or virtual reality. By processing data closer to the user, MEC helps speed up services that require near-instant responses.

Why 5G Standalone (SA) Matters:
5G SA unlocks the full potential of 5G. Here’s why it’s important:
- It supports revolutionary technologies like self-driving cars, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR).
- It’s perfect for the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), where machines and devices communicate with each other, like in smart factories.
- Ultra-low latency: 5G SA can deliver near-instant responses, essential for critical applications like healthcare (e.g., remote surgeries) or autonomous vehicles.

Summary of Key Points:
- 5G SA is the complete 5G network, independent of 4G.
- Devices connect directly to 5G base stations, using advanced frequency bands (Sub-6 GHz and millimeter waves).
- The 5G core network is built using a service-based architecture (SBA) with many specialized functions to handle everything from user data to network security.
- MEC technology provides ultra-low latency and high-speed connections, crucial for advanced technologies like self-driving cars and virtual reality.

With 5G SA, the network is prepared to handle the high demands of the future, offering faster, more reliable connections and supporting a wide range of advanced applications.
