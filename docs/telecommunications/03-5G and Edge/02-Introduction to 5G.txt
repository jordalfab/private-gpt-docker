
5G Standars and Specification
Let’s understand the standard bodies working on evolving the 5G ecosystem, specifically the ITU and 3GPP.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) continuously defines the overall concept behind 5G technology, including technical performance and service requirements. ITU sets the design goals and key deliverables in terms of speed, latency, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).
These guidelines are then further specified by another governing body, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). 3GPP produces reports and specifications that define 3GPP technologies based on the guidelines provided by the ITU. Essentially, ITU translates performance and service requirements to 3GPP, which then produces the necessary reports and specifications. If there are any recommendations, 3GPP also provides them.
3GPP releases new specifications periodically to incorporate new features and advancements. Let’s look at the different phases and releases:
2G Technology: Started with Phase 1 and went up to Release 98, covering specifications until 1998.
3G Technology: From Release 99 to Release 7, covering the period up to 2007.
4G Technology: From Release 8 to Release 14, focusing exclusively on 4G technology.
5G Technology: All releases after Release 14 are related to 5G technology. Currently, work is in progress for Release 18, and we can expect further updates and new specifications from 3GPP in the coming months or years.
