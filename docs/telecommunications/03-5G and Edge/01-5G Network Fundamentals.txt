Telecom Network
In a traditional radio access network, we have a baseband unit at the bottom of the mast and antennas at the top. The rectangular antennas, also known as GSM antennas, transmit signals from the base station and cover a certain area. The circular antennas are microwave antennas used for the transport network.
In the context of telecom networks, a mast typically refers to the structure that holds antennas for transmitting and receiving signals.
Each cell site connects back to the core network, which then routes data either to the data network or the PSTN. When transferring information from a user device to the base station and then to the transport network, there are two options: using fiber cables or microwave antennas.
Microwave antennas at cell sites connect to layer two switches, which then link to a hub location, sending data back to the core network. The core network, also known as a data center in telecom infrastructure, handles all data between user devices and the data or voice network.
This is the traditional network setup. The main changes with 5G involve the devices in the radio access network. For now, it’s important to understand the basic structure at the cell site level. Data from user devices goes through the antenna to the base station, then to the core network via the transport network, using either fiber or microwave antennas

Traditional RAN (Radius Access Network)
The antennas communicate with nearby users and send information back through black feeder cables to a cabinet at the bottom.
Inside this cabinet, there are various devices. On the left side, there’s a baseband unit, and on the right, there are radio units for different technologies. Different frequencies require different radio units. The baseband unit processes data at layers two and three.
For now, let’s understand the connections. The radio module connects to the antenna via jumper cables. The black cables, known as CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) cables, connect the radio modules to the baseband unit. CPRI is a standard interface for communication between these devices, handling tasks like inverse Fourier transform processing, modulation, channel coding, and interleaving.
In 5G, this interface is evolving to become more open. The baseband unit connects to the transport network via an Ethernet cable, which then links to the core network. The transport network can use either microwave antennas or fiber cables to connect back to the core network or data center.

Traditional Network
A telecom network consists of three subnetworks: the radio access network, the transport network, and the core network. There are several issues and areas for improvement in legacy technologies:
1. Proprietary Systems: Legacy networks use proprietary, bare metal hardware from a single supplier. This means the hardware and software are tightly coupled and provided by the same supplier, limiting innovation and flexibility.
2. Lack of Flexibility: With only one or two suppliers, there’s less room for innovation. The network lacks flexibility and agility because third-party functionalities cannot be easily integrated due to interoperability issues.
3. Service Segregation: Legacy networks do not allow for the segregation of services and applications. For example, moving some functionalities of the baseband unit to a hub site between the data center and the radio access network for resource pooling is not possible. Real-time functionalities that need to stay at the cell site also cannot be separated.
4. Core Network Limitations: In the core network, user plane functions cannot be moved closer to the user to provide low latency services. This limits the use cases and scope for innovation.
Overall, the conventional 4G infrastructure is limited by its proprietary nature, lack of flexibility, and inability to support third-party innovations

Building blocks of 5G
Let’s focus on the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN). In 5G, the radio unit remains at the mast, but new components called the Distributed Unit (DU) and Central Unit (CU) are added. The next-generation Node B, or gNode B, splits the baseband unit into the DU and CU.
Advantages:
- Real-Time Functions: Critical, real-time functions stay close to the cell site.
- Virtualization: Non-real-time functions can be pooled and virtualized at a regional data center, serving multiple sites. This allows for dynamic resource allocation, unlike the fixed, underutilized resources in conventional networks.
From the core network perspective, some functions can be placed at the data center or closer to the edge, such as the user plane function for low latency services. This flexibility is achievable with 5G.
Key 5G Building Blocks:
- Flexible Frame Structure: Different bandwidths for various services.
- Advanced Techniques: Massive MIMO and Beamforming.
- Edge Computing: Useful for telco cloud.
- Software-Defined Networking: Connects different nodes and subnetworks.
- Network Slicing: Provides different use cases.

Traditional vs 5G Network Architecture
In 4G, we have proprietary hardware for both the radio and core networks, connected by a transport network known as the backhaul.
Evolution to 5G:
- Virtualization: In 5G, some functionalities can be virtualized and placed at a hub location, allowing for on-demand use.
- Midhaul Introduction: The transport network now includes a midhaul, which has specific requirements to support low latency and high-speed services like enhanced mobile broadband.
Virtualized Core:
The core network is becoming more virtualized, followed by the radio access network. Virtualization allows us to create virtual machines on hardware, running any required functionality, which saves on hardware costs and increases efficiency.
Key Innovations in 5G:
- Cloudification and Virtualization: These are crucial for creating an innovative and agile network.
- Flexible Frame Structure and Bandwidths: 5G offers a wide range of bandwidths for various services, providing lower latency and enhanced broadband.
- Advanced Techniques: Techniques like massive MIMO and Beamforming, edge computing, software-defined networking, and network slicing enable new applications and services.
These innovations make the 5G network more flexible, efficient, and capable of supporting a broader range of use cases compared to 4G

5G New Radio (NR) Architecture
In 5G, the baseband unit is divided into two parts: the Distributed Unit (DU) and the Central Unit (CU). These units are becoming virtualized and moving towards cloudification and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN).
4G vs. 5G:
- In 4G, the baseband unit handles all protocol layers and functionalities.
- In 5G, real-time functions are managed by the DU, while non-critical functions are handled by the CU.
Protocol Details:
- Radio Unit (RU): Converts signals between analog and digital. It handles time-to-frequency and frequency-to-time domain conversions.
- Distributed Unit (DU): Manages higher physical layer tasks like modulation, coding, rate matching, and resource scheduling. It also handles automatic repeat requests (ARQ) at the RLC layer.
- Central Unit (CU): Introduces the Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP) for Quality of Service (QoS) flow handling. It manages communication with the core network via the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol.
Advantages:
- Virtualization: Allows for flexible and efficient resource allocation.
- Cloudification: Enhances network agility and innovation.

Transport Network Architecture
Let’s understand the transport network architecture by comparing 4G and 5G.
4G Transport Network:
Fronthaul: Connects the baseband unit to the radio unit using the CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) protocol, which supports up to 10 Gbps. This was sufficient for 4G’s less stringent requirements for throughput and latency.
5G Transport Network:
Enhanced Fronthaul: Uses the evolved eCPRI protocol, supporting up to 50 Gbps and a latency of less than 0.1 milliseconds. This meets 5G’s higher data rate and lower latency requirements.
Midhaul: New in 5G, it connects the Distributed Unit (DU) and Central Unit (CU). It can use both fiber and wireless backhaul (microwave). The requirements are less stringent than fronthaul but still significant, with data rates up to 10 Gbps and latency under 2 milliseconds. The distance between DU and CU can be up to 200 km.
Backhaul: Connects the edge location (with multiple CUs and User Plane Functions) to the core network. It requires data rates up to 100 Gbps and latency under 10 milliseconds.
These enhancements in 5G’s transport network architecture enable higher data rates, lower latency, and greater flexibility compared to 4G.

Transport NW Architecture - Service level
Let’s understand the transport network architecture and how it has evolved in 5G, focusing on the different services it needs to deliver.
5G Services:
- Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Services (URLLC)
- Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)
- Machine-to-Machine Communication (M2M)
These services have specific latency requirements, which can be met by placing devices at different locations within the network.
4G vs. 5G:
- In 4G, there was no concept of edge or regional clouds, with only one data center at the backend.
- In 5G, we disaggregate the Distributed Unit (DU) and Radio Unit (RU) at the cell site and also separate some core functionalities.
Key Components:
- User Plane Function (UPF): Can be placed at the edge cloud to handle low latency services.
- Central Unit (CU): Some functionalities are moved closer to the edge or regional location to meet stringent latency requirements.
Latency Requirements:
- ITU Standard: 1 millisecond one-way delay.
- 3GPP Standard: Even stricter at 0.5 milliseconds.
To meet these requirements, the fronthaul (connectivity between RU and DU) must have a latency of less than 0.1 milliseconds and a distance of less than 20 kilometers.
Flexible Placement:
- Edge or regional clouds can be used depending on the distance from the cell site. While the latency requirement for midhaul (between DU and CU) is less stringent than fronthaul, it is still significant.
- As we move towards the core network, the latency requirements become more relaxed since most real-time activities are handled closer to the user.
This flexible placement of units in 5G allows for better performance and efficiency compared to legacy technologies.

5G SA Architecture: Core Network Nodes/Functions (Non - Roaming)
Now, let’s understand the core network, the third crucial component of a telecom network.
Core Network Functions:
- Secure Connections: Establishes secure connections among all devices in the 5G network.
- Policies and Charging: Applies policies and charges users based on the services they use.
- Mobility and Session Management: Manages user mobility and session management.
- Traffic Routing: Routes different types of traffic and prioritizes services as needed.
Standalone vs. Non-Standalone Architecture:
- Standalone: Only one radio access network (e.g., 5G) is present.
- Non-Standalone: More than one radio access network (e.g., 4G and 5G) is present. This is common in brownfield networks with legacy technologies like 4G and 3G.
4G vs. 5G Core Network:
- 4G: Uses a single entity called the Mobility Management Entity (MME) for session and mobility management.
- 5G: Adopts a CUPS (Control and User Plane Separation) architecture, separating control and user planes. This allows for better Quality of Service (QoS) implementation and supports new functionalities like network slicing.
In summary, the core network in 5G is more flexible and efficient, enabling advanced features and better performance compared to 4G.

5G SA Architecture: Core Network Nodes/Functions (Non-Roaming)
Let’s understand the 5G standalone architecture and the different nodes in the core network.
Control Plane Connectivity:
- AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function): The first node a user connects to for authentication and mobility management. It works with the AUSF (Authentication Server Function) and UDM (Unified Data Management) to verify user subscriptions.
- AUSF: Authenticates users by communicating with the UDM, which holds user subscription data.
- UDM: Confirms user legitimacy and subscription details.
- PCF (Policy Control Function): Manages service policies, billing, and roaming permissions.
- SMF (Session Management Function): Handles session management, IP allocation, and traffic steering between the core network and the user equipment (UE).
User Plane Connectivity:
- UPF (User Plane Function): Manages the transmission of user data between the device and the core network. It handles packet routing, forwarding, QoS (Quality of Service), and connects to external data networks.
Key Points:
- Standalone Architecture: Only one radio access network (e.g., 5G) is present.
- Non-Standalone Architecture: More than one radio access network (e.g., 4G and 5G) is present.
- CUPS (Control and User Plane Separation): Separates control and user planes for better QoS and network slicing.
This architecture allows for more efficient and flexible network management, supporting advanced 5G functionalities.
