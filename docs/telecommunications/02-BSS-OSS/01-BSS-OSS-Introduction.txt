What are Support Systems and their Classification?
Computer systems and software applications used in these activities are referred to as support systems. These support systems can be further subdivided into two main categories:
1. Operational Support Systems (OSS). These systems are used to directly support network operations. Examples include:
- Keeping a record of the inventory available in the network.
- Providing telecom services using the network.
- Configuring network components to enable telecom services.
- Managing faults in the telecom network.
2. Business Support Systems (BSS). These systems are used to directly support business-related activities. Examples include:
- Taking orders from customers.
- Processing customer bills.
- Collecting payments from customers.
- Sales and marketing of telecom services.
- Customer care.

The Bigger Picture: Business Support System (BSS)
To understand the bigger picture of how the Business Support System (BSS) and the Operational Support System (OSS) interact with each other and with the network, let’s consider this diagram.
The diagram consists of four layers, with devices at the bottom-most layer. Depending on the network type, the required device varies:
- For a mobile wireless network (e.g., 5G, 4G, 3G), a mobile station is used.
- For a DSL network, a DSL modem is needed.
- For a fixed telephony network or a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a fixed telephone is required.
Since our focus is on mobile wireless networks, we’ll assume the device in use is a mobile station.
Before this mobile station can use the services of the mobile wireless network, these services need to be activated. This is where the Business Support System (BSS) comes into play. The first component of the BSS is the product catalog, which includes various plans such as prepaid, postpaid, and international roaming plans.
The user of the mobile station selects one or more plans from the product catalog. For example, if the user chooses a postpaid plan, the next step involves the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The CRM system registers the user and stores data that can be used for future lead generation, allowing the communication service provider to offer additional services based on this data.
Assuming the user has selected and placed an order for a postpaid plan, the next step is order management. During this step, the order is checked and verified, and the postpaid service is activated. The BSS sends the order to the OSS, which then activates the service in the network.
Once the service is activated, the user is charged for its usage. At the end of the month, a bill is generated for the service usage. This billing process is part of the revenue management system within the BSS.
Here, we see that the user directly interacts with the BSS to activate services, which is why these activities are referred to as customer-facing activities and are part of the BSS.

The Bigger Picture: Operational Support System (OSS)
In the previous step, we saw that the Business Support System (BSS) sends the order to the Operational Support System (OSS), which is responsible for service provisioning related to this order.
To deliver this service, the OSS first checks the network inventory to ensure sufficient resources are available. This includes verifying if the necessary capacity exists in the network to activate the service. If the network inventory confirms that the service can be provided, the service is then activated in the network.
To activate the service, the OSS sends a message to the network containing the required parameters for activation. Once the service is activated, it is crucial that it operates flawlessly. Service assurance, including customer care related to any faults, is also the responsibility of the OSS.
Another important aspect of the OSS is network management, which is handled by the Network Management System (NMS). The NMS monitors the network to ensure it is functioning properly, maintaining good performance, and that the services provided are working correctly. Any faults in the network or services are rectified and managed using the NMS.
Here, we see that the OSS directly interacts with the network, which is why these activities are referred to as network-facing activities.

Summarizing importance of OSS & BSS
In summary, we have a network infrastructure that is used to deliver services to customers. Managing and monitoring this network infrastructure is done using the Operational Support System (OSS) and the Business Support System (BSS).
While delivering services to customers, we need to manage these services and the associated business aspects. This is also handled by the OSS and BSS.
Additionally, we need to manage customer interactions, including marketing network services, delivering these services, and providing customer care in case of service faults. All these tasks are performed using the OSS and BSS, along with the software applications that implement these systems.
Therefore, the OSS and BSS are critical components of a communication service provider’s business.

Advantages of Automating OSS/BSS
Automating the Operational Support System (OSS) and Business Support System (BSS) using computer systems and software applications offers numerous advantages:
1. Reduced Time for Service Creation and Delivery. Automation significantly cuts down the time required to create and deliver new services to customers.
2. Efficient Network Monitoring and Operation. The network can be monitored more efficiently, leading to smoother operations and quicker fault resolution.
3. Lower Operational Costs. Automation reduces the operational costs of the network, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
4. Increased Customer Satisfaction. Faster fault resolution leads to higher customer satisfaction, which in turn boosts subscriber retention for the communication service provider.
5. Improved Return on Investment (ROI). Enhanced operational efficiency and customer satisfaction translate into better ROI for the communication service provider. This includes the overall investment in network deployment, personnel hiring, and network and service operations.

A Generic Process Flow for a Service and its Basic Building Blocks
Before we delve further into the OSS and BSS, it is important to understand the generic process flow for a service, whether it is a prepaid or postpaid service, and the basic building blocks involved from service selection in the product catalog to charging and billing.
1. Product Catalog:
- The first building block is the product catalog, which is part of the BSS.
- The product catalog manages the products offered by the communication service provider.
- These product offerings include definitions of data services, voice services, SMS services, content provision services, or combinations of these services.
- Products can be either prepaid or postpaid, each with its own price configuration.
2. Information Sharing:
- Information about these products is not only stored in the product catalog but must also be accessible to other components such as the CRM, order management system, and charging and billing system.

Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
The Customer Relationship Management (CRM) block is an integral part of the Business Support System (BSS). CRM is a system that enables business administrators in a Communication Service Provider (CSP) to interact with customers through various channels:
- Call Center: Customers can call the CSP’s call center and speak with a representative.
- Company Portal: Interaction can occur through the CSP’s website.
- SMS, Email, Live Chat, Social Media: Customers can use these channels to communicate with the CSP.
- Company Store: Customers can visit the CSP’s business store and interact with representatives in person.
CRM procedures can be automated using CRM software, which offers several functionalities:
1. Customer Interactions:
- CRM software facilitates customer interactions, including registering customers and creating accounts.
- Sales representatives can use the CRM software to register customers, or customers can self-register via the company web portal.
- Required documents for registration can be uploaded through the CRM software.
2. Order Placement and Payment Collection:
- Customers can place orders for various products, and payments can be collected using the CRM software.
3. Notifications:
- CRM software can send notifications to customers about the status of their orders.
4. Query Management:
- Customers can send queries through the CRM software, and corresponding experts, such as sales and marketing representatives, can respond.
5. Business Intelligence:
- Based on customer data stored in the CRM software, including order history and interaction patterns, business intelligence reports can be generated to provide insights into the customer base.

Registration
Registration is a crucial part of the CRM process. During registration, the data of a new customer is created in the CRM system, which is part of the CSP’s network. The registration procedure involves the following steps:
1. Collecting Personal Information:
- Gather the customer’s personal information, such as their name, national identification number, and contact details.
- Enter this information into the CRM system.
2. Verifying Identity:
- Verify the customer’s identity using the provided information.
3. Creating an Account:
- Once the customer’s identity is verified, create an account for them in the CRM system.
- Assign a service identity to the customer, which they will use to access the telecom network services.
At this point, the registration procedure is complete. The customer can now order their selected plan using the CRM system. Additionally, billing information is entered into the CRM, specifying how the customer will pay for the selected plan (e.g., using a credit card).

Order Management
After the CRM block passes the order to the order management block, which is also part of the BSS, the order management block verifies the order for completeness and correctness. It also determines the necessary steps for service provision.
The order management block interacts with the inventory management block to check if sufficient resources are available to fulfill the requested service. For example, it verifies if the required resources are available for a new customer and if there is sufficient capacity in the requested service area. If any manual installation is required, the order management block coordinates with the workforce management module to ensure the CSP’s workforce can perform the installation and setup.
Next, the order management block triggers the provisioning and activation block by sending the order information as a string. For instance, if the selected service is a postpaid voice service over a 3G network, this information is sent to the provisioning and activation block. The block then converts this information into machine language, which the network understands. This information is stored in the central database, and the service is activated in the network.
Once the service is activated, the order management block updates the inventory management block on the status of the resources now in use. Simultaneously, it initiates the charging and billing process for the activated service.
Finally, the order management block informs the user via the CRM that the order is complete, the service is activated, and the user can now use the service.

Charging
Once a service is active in the network, the charging and billing processes are also activated. Charging is crucial for a communication service provider as it allows them to bill customers based on their service usage.
There are two main types of charging:
1. Online Charging System (OCS):
- Used for prepaid services.
- This is real-time charging, meaning the customer has credit in their account, and as they use the service, the credit is deducted based on usage.
2. Offline Charging:
- Used for postpaid services.
- This is non-real-time charging, meaning the user uses the service, and the usage is recorded. However, charging and bill generation occur after the billing cycle, which is typically a month. The user then pays the bill after it is generated.
