Data Estate Modernization For Communications
The cloud provides CSPs with a way to overcome the most serious challenges on data infrastructures, including data accessibility, scalability at controlled cost, availability of advanced analytics/AI tools, and infrastructure agility. Cloud data platforms empower the digital transformation by enabling the key analytical use cases of CSPs across customer management, network management and business management. The cloud strategy for data estates can be driven by use cases, redeveloping them in cloud-native form, or driven by platforms, supporting a quicker transition. In either case,
IDEA helps CSPs benefit from Capgemini’s range of experience in data estate modernization to secure and accelerate the transition, shortening the delivery time by up to 40%.

Point-of-view: Data-driven Open Assurance
To be useful and fulfill its promises, data needs to be liberated, accessible, and understood – and it is not today in most legacy OSS architectures. CSPs can start implementing an Open Assurance framework today to bring the full benefits of modern AI and analytics. They can then get a deeper, more holistic understanding of their operations and bring information to bear more rapidly. They can build better closed-loop automation for more autonomous networks, thus simultaneously enabling higher efficiency and higher quality of service. High investment costs in new network technologies
and threatened margins make it necessary to optimize operations costs while satisfying strong demands for quality from customers. CSPs need to transform their operations in general, and Service Assurance more specifically. We have shown how Open Assurance can be implemented in an agile, iterative way into legacy OSSs, morphing them into a more agile, data-driven OSS supporting a higher level of network autonomy, while avoiding the risks associated with massive upheavals.
